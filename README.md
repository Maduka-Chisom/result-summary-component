### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

- CREATING TRANSITION ON BACKGROUND IMAGE.
  After trying to create a transition animation on a hover gradient background image using the code below:

     <!-- TRANSITION DID NOT WORK  -->

  ```css
  .continue:link,
  .continue:visited {
    background-color: hsl(224, 30%, 27%);
    border-radius: 50px;
    padding: 1rem 2rem;
    display: flex;
    margin-top: 3rem;
    text-decoration: none;
    color: hsl(221, 100%, 96%);
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    cursor: pointer;
    border: none;
    position: relative;
    transition: background-image 10s linear;
  }

  .continue:hover,
  .continue:active {
    background-image: linear-gradient(
      to bottom,
      rgb(120, 87, 255),
      rgb(46, 43, 233)
    );
  }
  ```

  After trying and meeting road blocks, i did some research and found the solution on google. here is the solution:

```css
.continue:link,
.continue:visited {
  background-color: hsl(224, 30%, 27%);
  border-radius: 50px;
  padding: 1rem 2rem;
  display: flex;
  margin-top: 3rem;
  text-decoration: none;
  color: hsl(221, 100%, 96%);
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  cursor: pointer;
  border: none;
  position: relative;
}

/* TRANSITION WORKED */
.continue::before {
  position: absolute;
  content: "";
  top: 0;
  right: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  left: 0;
  background-image: linear-gradient(
    to bottom,
    rgb(120, 87, 255),
    rgb(46, 43, 233)
  );
  opacity: 0;
  transition: opacity 0.3s linear;
  z-index: -1;
  border-radius: 50px;
}

.continue:hover::before,
.continue:active::before {
  opacity: 1;
}
```

- learnt how to set up Git and Homebrew

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

- Building more projects with css and html

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/setup-git-on-mac/) - This helped me for Git and homebrew set up.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/learn/lecture/27513370#overview) - This is an amazing course which helped me understand html and css. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
